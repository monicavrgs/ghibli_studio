        <Text>This is the first project I developed by myself using React and actually put into practice what I've learned from courses. Since I'm not a designer, the design is very simple as the focus of this project was to practice React and it's purpose is to only organize the website.</Text>
        <Text>I also used styled-components to develop the project and it's content it's from the <Link href='https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/?ref=public-apis#section/Studio-Ghibli-API'>Studio Ghibli API</Link>.</Text>
